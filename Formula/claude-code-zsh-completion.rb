    # Keep every completion around so a locale can be swapped in later

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The English completion is active. To use a localized one instead, link it
      over the installed file, e.g. for Japanese:
        ln -sf #{opt_pkgshare}/completions/_claude.ja #{zsh_completion}/_claude

      Available locales:
        ls #{opt_pkgshare}/completions
    EOS
  end

  test do
    completion = zsh_completion/"_claude"

    assert_match "#compdef claude", completion.read
    assert_path_exists pkgshare/"completions/_claude.ja"

    system "zsh", "-n", completion
  end
end
